My(Reububble's) solutions to [Advent of code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) using [Deno](https://deno.com)

Automatically downloads and caches input files before running the stage's solution, then submitting the answer.

Can be manually triggered through github actions, though I prefer not to so that I can debug the program.

When run locally, will not submit before manual confirmation.

All requests are sent with User-Agent field set with a link to this repo.
